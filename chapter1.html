<div id="part1"><p>Civic education is an education that studies about 
the rights and responsibilities  of citizens  of  a  politically 
organized  group  of people.<br> Different  writers  define it  in 
many  ways.  For  instance,  Patrick  (1986)  defines  civic  education 
 as  the  knowledge  of  the 
constitutions,  the  principles,  values,  history  and  application  to
  contemporary  life.  Citizenshi p 
education can be understood as the knowledge, means, and activities 
designed to encourage students 
to  participate actively in  democratic  life,  accepting  and  
exercising  their  rights  and  responsibilities.United Nations 
Development Program (UNDP, 2004) defines civic education as a way of 
learning for effective participation in a democratic and development 
process. On his part, Aggarwal (1982) linked  civic  education  to  the 
 development  of  ideas,  habits,  behaviors  and  useful  attitudes  in
  the individual which enables him to be a useful member of the society.
 Still the subject matter can be also defined as the process of helping 
young people acquire and learn to use the skills, knowledge, and 
attitudes that will prepare them to be competent and responsible 
citizens throughout their lives.</p></div>
<div id="h2"><h2>definition and nature of ethics and morality</h2></div>
<div id="part2"><p>Ethics  is  a  branch  of  philosophy  that  attempts
  to  understand  people’s  moral  beliefs  and  actions. Ethics,  or  
moral 
philosophy, considers theories about what human beings are capable of 
doing, alongside accounts of what they ought to do if they are to live 
an ethically good life. <br>Ethical questions are not concerned with 
what one would do (an essentially psychological  concern)  but  what  
one  ought  to  do.  Judgments  about  such  decisions  are  generally 
expressed with words like right and wrong, should and ought, or 
obligation and duty.<br>morality refers to the degree to 
which  an  action  conforms  to  a  standard  or  norm  of  human  
conduct.  Ethics  refers  to  the philosophical study of values and of 
what constitute good and bad human conduct. <br>  Morality from a 
dictionary definition (from  Latin  moralitas  “manner,  character,  
proper behavior”) refers to the concept of human action which pertains 
to matters of right and wrong also referred to as “good and evil”.It can
 be used to mean the generally accepted code of conduct in a society, or
 within a subgroup of society.<br>Morality is, at the very least, the 
effort to guide one’s conduct by reason that is, to do  what there are 
the best reasons for doing while giving equal weight to the interest of 
each individual who will be 
affected by one’s conduct. It is important that in a countries like 
Ethiopia, morality is shared as a common goal to ensure harmony and 
integrity.Morality is used to refer to what we would call moral conduct 
while ethics is used to refer to the formal study of moral conduct. It 
can be claimed that morality is related to praxis, but ethics is related
 to theory.</p></div>

<div id="part3"><p> Laws are norms, formally approved by state, power or
  national or international political bodies. there are several reasons 
why ethics is not law.</p><div id="kl"><br>Firstly, some actions that are illegal may not be unethical.<br> Second, some actions that are unethical may not be illegal.<br>Third, laws can be unethical or immoral.<br>Fourth, we use different  kinds  of mechanisms  to  express,  teach,  inculcate, and  enforce  laws  and  ethics.<br>Finally, we use the coercive  power  of  government  to  enforce  laws.</div><p></p></div>
