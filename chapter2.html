<div id="part1"><p>It have  been  of  two  sorts:  (1)  deontological  theories  and  (2)  teleological  ones.Any  theory that looks solely to consequences of actions is known as a Consequentialist theory.</p> </div>
<div id="h2"><h2>teleological ethics</h2></div>
<div id="part2"><p>A teleological  theory  says  that  the  basic  or  ultimate  criterion  or  standard  of  what  is  morally  right, wrong, obligatory, etc., is the non-moral value that is brought into being. The final appeal, directly or indirectly,  must  be  to  the  comparative  amount  of  good  produced,  or  rather  to   the  comparative balance of good over evil produced. Teleologists believe that   there is one and only one basic or ultimate right-making characteristic, namely, the comparative value (nonmoral) of what is, probably  will  be,  or  is  intended  to  be  brought  into  being.<br>egoism implies that we ought to be selfish. Or, to put it more gently, we ought to be self-interested.Ethical egoism tells you that it is perfectly all right to treat others in a way that is to your advantage and not to theirs as long as you can be certain that you will get away with it.Ethical egoism does not forbid one to help others, or require one to harm others. It just says that whatever moral reason you have to help others, or not harm them, must ultimately stem for the way in which helping them or not harming them helps you.<br>Thus, ethical egoism has generally presupposed what is called  psychological egoism  --  that each of us is always  seeking  his  own  greatest  good,  whether  this  is  conceived  of  as  pleasure,  happiness, knowledge, power, self-realization, or a mixed life.Our basic ethical principle must be that of self-love, albeit cool self-love.<br> ethical egoism, the  view that the act that produces  the  most  amount  of  good  for  the  agent  is  the  right  act.  Egoism  is  teleological  ethics 
narrowed  to  the  agent  himself  or  herself.  Unlike  ethical  egoism,  utilitarianism  is  a  universal teleological  system.  It  calls  for  the  maximization  of  goodness  in  society—that  is,  the  greatest goodness for the greatest number—and not merely the good of the agent.<br>There are two classical types of utilitarianism: act- and rule-utilitarianism.<br>Act-utilitarianism  argues that an act is right if and only if it results in as much good  as any available alternative.<br>Rule-utilitarianism: An act is right if and only if it is required by a rule that is itself a member of a set of rules whose acceptance would lead to greater utility for society  than any available alternative.<br>Utilitarianism  has  three  very positive  features.  The first  attraction  or  strength  is  that  it  is  a  single principle, an absolute system with a potential answer for every situation. Its second strength is that utilitarianism seems to get to the substance of morality. A  third  strength  of  utilitarianism  is  that  it  is  particularly  well  suited  to  address  the  problem  of 
posterity—namely,  why  we  should  preserve  scarce  natural  resources  for  the  betterment  of  future 
generations of humans that do not yet exist.Utilitarianism has been around for several centuries, but so too have been its critics.Problems with Formulating Utilitarianism,The Comparative Consequences Objection,The Consistency Objection to Rule-Utilitarianism,The No-Rest Objection,The Publicity Objection,Criticism of the Ends Justifying Immoral Means,The Lying Objection,The Justice Objection.<br>In altruism an action is right if the consequences of that action are favorable to all except the actor.Psychological altruism holds that all human action is necessarily other centered and other motivated. Altruists reject the theory of psychological egoism and argue 
instead  that  humans  are  instinctively  benevolent. </p></div>

<div id="h3"><h2>deontological ethics</h2></div>
<div id="part3"><p>It is referred as “the means justifies the end”. It is coined as “ deontics”. This is a theory that the rightness or wrongness of moral action is determined, at least partly with reference to formal rules of conduct  rather  than  consequences  or  result  of  an  action.The  17th  century  German  philosopher  Samuel  Pufendorf,  who  classified  dozens  of  duties  under 
    three headings: duties to God, duties to oneself and duties to others!
    <br>Concerning our duties towards God, he argued that there are two kinds: (1) a theoretical duty to 
    know  the  existence  and  nature  of  God,  and  (2)  a  practical  duty  to  both  inwardly  and  outwardly 
    worship God. 
    <br>Concerning our duties towards oneself; these are also of two sorts: (1) duties of the soul, which 
    involve developing one's skills and talents, and (2) duties of the body, which involve not harming 
    our bodies, as we might through gluttony or drunkenness, and not killing oneself. 
    <br>Concerning our duties towards others; Pufendorf divides these between absolute duties, which 
    are universally binding on people, and conditional duties, which are the result of contracts between 
    people. 
   <br> Absolute duties are of three sorts: (1) avoid wronging others; (2) treat people as equals, and (3) 
    promote the good of others. 
    Conditional duties involve various types of agreements,  the principal one of which is the duty is to 
    keep one's promises. </p></div>
