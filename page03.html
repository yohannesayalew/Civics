<div id="part1"><p>According to one view, called the divine command theory (DCT), ethical principles are simply the 
commands  of  God.  They  derive  their  validity  from  God’s  commanding  them,  and  they  mean “commanded by God.” Without God, there would be  no universally valid morality.We can analyze 
the DCT into three separate theses:<br>1.  Morality (that is, rightness and wrongness) originates with God.<br>2.  Moral rightness simply means “willed by God,” and moral wrongness means “being against the 
will of God.”
<br> 3. Because morality essentially is based on divine will, not on independently existing reasons for 
action, no further reasons for action are necessary. Morality not only originates with God, but moral rightness 
simply means “willed by God” and moral wrongness means “being against the will of God”.Without God, we have moral nihilism. If there is no God, then nothing is ethically wrong, required, 
or permitted. </p></div>

<div id="part2"><p> Rights and duties are related in such a way that the rights of one person imply the duties of another   person.There are four features traditionally associated with moral rights. 
<br>   First, rights are natural insofar as they are not invented or created by governments. 
<br>   Second, they are universal insofar as they do not change from country to country. 
<br>    Third,  they  are  equal  in  the  sense  that  rights  are  the  same  for  all  people,  irrespective  of 
<br> gender, race, or handicap. 
<br>   Fourth, they are inalienable which means that I cannot hand over my rights to another person, 
such as by selling myself into slavery. </p></div>
<div id="h3"><h1>Kant's Categorical Imperative</h1></div>
<div id="part3">A Kant’s duty-based theory is emphasizes a single principle of duty.Kant believed, that there was just  one  command  or  imperative  that  was  categorical,  that  is,  one  that  presented  an  action  as 
necessary  of  itself,  without  regard  to  any  other  end.  He  believed  that  from  this  one  categorical 
imperative,  this  universal  command,  all  commands  of  duty  could  be  derived. <div id="point">Kant’s  categorical 
imperative states that  we  should act in such a way that the maxim or general rule governing our a ction could be a 
universal law.Kant's theory is hinged by his beliefs on  autonomy  and his formulation of categorical imperatives.Autonomy is one’s own beliefs, independence, and government: acting without regard for anyone 
else.  Conversely,  heteronomy  is  acting  under  the  influence  of  someone  else  and  allows  for  an 
individual to consistently place blame outside of self.The main problem with the categorical imperative is its rigidity. </div>  <p></p></div>

<div id="h4"><h1>Ross’s Prima Facie Duties or Moral Guidelines</h1></div>
<div id="part4"><p>A  fourth  and  more  recent  duty-based  theory  is  that  by  British  philosopher  W.D.  Ross,  which emphasizes  prima facie  duties.The term  prima facie  means “at a first sight” or “on the surface.” By prima facie duties, Ross means duties that dictate what we should do when other moral factors are not considered.prima facie duties are duties 
that  generally  obligate  us;  that  is,  they  ordinarily  impose  a  moral  obligation  but  may  not  in  a particular case because of circumstances. An  actual duty  is the action that one ought to perform after considering and weighing all the prima facie duties involved.</p></div>
